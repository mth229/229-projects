{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p>Unlike a calculator, but just like math, <code>Julia</code> has different types of numbers: integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. For the most part the distinction isn't much to worry about, but there are times where one must, such as overflow with integers. (One can only take the factorial of 20 with 64-bit integers, whereas on most calculators a factorial of 69 can be taken, but not 70.) Julia automatically assigns a type when it parses a value: a <code>1</code> will be an integer, a <code>1.0</code> an floating point number. Rational numbers are made by using two division symbols, <code>1//2</code>.</p>","metadata":{}},
{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p>For many operations the type will be conserved, such as adding to integers. For some operations, the type will be converted, such as dividing two integer values.
